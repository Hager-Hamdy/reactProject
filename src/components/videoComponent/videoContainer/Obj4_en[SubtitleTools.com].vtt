00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.970
welcome to a number of important Marshall in this course

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.810
testing react apps not with testing here I don't mean

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.730
us manually clicking around our application we already do that

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.990
constantly while developing it we've testing here I mean writing

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.510
automated tests and now here's something important what to what

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.370
I'm interrogatory of this module testing is a complex topic

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.450
and is actually a huge enough topic to make up

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.220
an entire records just on its own this is not

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.150
a testing in general introduction and it's also not a

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.770
complete reacts testing guide like mort you'll instead I will

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:47.520
introduce you into writing units tests for react applications build

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.830
with create react app and that can then be something
130
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:54,0
you build up on ward which helps you apply your
140
00:00:54,0 --> 00:00:57,430
general Java script testing all that you already have or

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.780
gabber in our resources with that out of the way

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.820
let's dive into what testing exactly is in the next

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.860
lecture and then learn how we can rights tests for

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.490
our react application
